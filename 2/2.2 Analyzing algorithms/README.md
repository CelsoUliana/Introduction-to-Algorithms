# Selection sort
Basic sorting algorithm, consists of finding the smallest element of array A and exchanging it with element at A[1] then finding second smallest and putting it in A[2]... until you reach n - 1 since at this point the n element is already the biggest and the array is therefore sorted.

## Properties
It is not a stable sorting algorithm, that is, the order of duplicate elements does change.
Worst-case time complexity O(nÂ²).
