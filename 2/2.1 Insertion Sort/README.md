# Insertion Sort
Basic sorting algorithm, works the same way as people would sort a hand of cards: Hold the cards with one hand and use the other hand to remove a card and put it in the correct position.
The way we find the correct position is to compare the card right to left (within sorted sequence). 

## Properties
It is a stable sorting algorithm, that is, order of duplicate elements does not change.
Worst-case time complexity O(nÂ²).
