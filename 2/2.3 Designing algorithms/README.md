# Merge sort
Sorting algorithm that uses the divide and conquer approach, splitting the array in half until the resulting array size is one (and sorted) and using the *Merge* procedure that consists of merging two already sorted arrays which is done is O(n) time. 

## Properties
It is a stable sorting algorithm, that is, order of duplicate elements does not change.
Worst-case time complexity O(nlogn) (log n + 1 splitting and n *merge*).
